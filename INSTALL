INSTALLING VERILOG MANGLER
==========================

You could just use the executable python script vmangle.py from this
directory, but to do a system-wide installation, do this:

./configure
make install

You need to do the "make install" part as root. After that, you can
run the program using "vmangle".

Check the README or do "vmangle --help" for usage information.
