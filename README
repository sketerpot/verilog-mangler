VERILOG MANGLER 0.1
===================

usage: vmangle [input-file] [output-file]

Puts a prefix in front of all Verilog module names, to prevent Quartus
from complaining about conflicts with its built-in library.

While this program will do the job faster and more safely than going
through and manually using the find/replace feature in Quartus for
every error, it's not perfect. It doesn't properly parse the Verilog
syntax, and the heuristics it uses are not perfect. However, it should
work for Balsa output.


Example:
--------

Suppose you have a file homework.balsa and you generate the Verilog
output homework.v from it. When you compile homework.v in Quartus, it
complains about modules with names like INV. You can run this command:

vmangle homework.v Balsa_homework.v

This will produce the file Balsa_homework.v with module names changed
from something like INV to something like __INV, which doesn't
conflict with Quartus. It will rename all modules this way, so you
should probably rename the top-level module to Balsa_homework. Then
try compiling that in Quartus, and it should work better.
